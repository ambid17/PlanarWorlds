# PlanarWorlds
A Dnd Map Maker and Campaign manager

Planar Worlds is based on 4 main features
* Terrain Mode. This has 2 settings: TileMap (2d) and Terrain (3D) 
* Prop Mode. This mimics the Unity Edtior, and allows the user to place objects into the scene. 
* Encounter Mode. This allows the user to control Initiative, fog of war, player locations, and stats.
* Serialization. This allows the user to save/load campaigns (with all of the accompanying data). This will also allow users to share their files and import campaigns
