Release 1.3:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : implemented support for the new input system. This was done to solve
				certain issues that appear when using RDC.

Release 1.2.2:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : implemented MeshVertexChunkCollectionDb.SetMeshDirty to allow vertex
				snapping to work correctly after a mesh is modified.

Release 1.2.1:
---------------------------------------------
[Improvement] : eliminated recursion from SphereTree;

[Bug Fix]	  : fixed SphereTree.IntegrateNodeRecurse stack overflow exception;

[New Feature] : added 'MinPositiveScale' and 'ScaleConstraintEnabled' properties to ObjectTransformGizmo;

[Improvement] : Optimized the RTScene::Update_SystemCall function. The client code is now required to call 
				RTScene.Get.OnGameObjectWillBeDestroyed whenever it destroys a game object and RTMeshDb.Get.OnMeshWillBeDestroyed 
				if it ever destroys a mesh asset at runtime.

[Removed]	  : removed unnecessary field from RTScene Inspector;

Release 1.1.4:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : added 'RemoveGizmo' function to the RTGizmosEngine class 
				to allow the client code to remove gizmos when they are
				no longer needed.

			    from the gizmo over the UI;

Release 1.1.3:
---------------------------------------------

Release 1.1.2:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : it is now possible to change the scene gizmo screen size.

Release 1.1.1:
---------------------------------------------
[Bug Fix]	  : fixed bug which was preventing gizmos from being dragged 
			    for certain camera angles.

Release 1.1:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : added 'SetAxesLinesHoverable' function to the 'MoveGizmo' class;
[New Feature] : added 'SetMidCapHoverable' function to the 'RotationGizmo' class;
[New Feature] : added 'SetAxesLinesHoverable' function to the 'ScaleGizmo' class;
[New Feature] : added 'SetMvAxesLinesHoverable' and 'SetRtMidCapHoverable' functions to the 'UniversalGizmo' class;

[Bug Fix]     : fixed scale & universal gizmos scaling objects incorrectly;
[Bug Fix]     : fixed scale snap step Inspector freeze for scale & universal gizmos;
[Bug Fix]	  : fixed mid scale cap for universal gizmo not hiding when switching to 2D mode;
[Bug Fix]	  : fixed bug in the 'OnHoverableStateChanged' function of the 'GizmoPlaneSlider3D' class;

Release 1.0.5:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : fixed incorrect mapping between Ids and gizmo handles (move, scale and universal);
[New Feature] : added SetRootObjectIgnored to RTScene class;

[Bug Fix]	  : fixed camera focus;
[Bug Fix]	  : fixed warnings about PrefabType being obsolete;
[Bug Fix]	  : fixed SphereTreeNode stack overflow bug;

Release 1.0.4:
---------------------------------------------
[New Feature] : gizmo states such as enabling/disabling snapping can now correctly be activated/deactivated
			    using the gizmo interface. Previously, this was not possible because these states would 
			    always be overwritten by the hotkeys;
[New Feature] : added 'Initialized' event for the RTGApp class;
[New Feature] : added 'OffsetDragAxisModify' event to the 'Gizmo' class which allows the client code to
				alter the drag axis produced while dragging gizmo offset/move handles;
[New Feature] : it is now possible to control the visibility of the universal gizmo's mid cap. This
			    is the shape (box by default) that is used to perform uniform scaling;

[New Feature] : it is now possible to choose the type of rotation switch performed by the camera;

Release 1.0.1
---------------------------------------------
[Bug Fix]: fixed bug which was causing buggy interaction with the gizmos for custom defined camera viewports;
