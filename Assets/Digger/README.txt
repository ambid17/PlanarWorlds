INSTALL DIGGER
==============

DIGGER requires the Burst package to compile. Follow these steps to install them:

1. Open the Package Manager (menu Windows > Package Manager).

2. Install the latest version of the packages "Burst".


From now on, there should not be any error in the console, and there should be a new menu: Tools > Digger.

If there is some error, please try to create a blank new project, follow the two steps again and then import DIGGER.
If, even after this, you get some errors, please contact us for support: https://discord.gg/C2X6C6s
